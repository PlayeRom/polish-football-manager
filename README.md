# Manager of the Polish League 2002

## Beginning

In 2002, when I was learing C/C++ programming, I created football manager game for DOS (in Borland C++ compiler).

You can find this original DOS version (sources and binaries) in *dos-original* folder (ugly fromatted and structural code) and you can still run the binaries by DOSBox.

## Porting to Linux

17 years later, when I found my old sources files in backup stored in CD-ROM, I decided to porting this game to Linux console with refactoring the code. In this repo you will find results of my porting.

At the moment, the game is in Polish language only.
